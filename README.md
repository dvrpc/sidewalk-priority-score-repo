# Sidewalk Priority Score

ArcPy code to calculate a priority score for sidewalk gaps. It starts with a road centerline layer with the percentage of sidewalk coverage on each side of the road. Other demographic, infrastructure, and destination data is then joined to that layer, assigned a score, weighted, and summed. For more, see the [methodology](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UHv8jroeQaBiPxKCRoQLoTLjtCE0rmaXnjVakTIqkBg/).
